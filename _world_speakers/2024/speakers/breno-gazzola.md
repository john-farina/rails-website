Breno is a Co-Founder and CTO of FestaLab, a brazilian startup for organizing events (birthday, baby shower, etc) and gifting, used by over 150k organizers and 5M guests per month.

Their majestic monolith was first built in 2018 as a Rails 5.1 app, but currently runs Rails Edge and they have contributed back to Rails some of the things they have developed for it (including the switch to “vips by default” in Rails 7). This monolith was also the test bed for Breno's collaboration on Propshaft and the first app to deploy it to production.
