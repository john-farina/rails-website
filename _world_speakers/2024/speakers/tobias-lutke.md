Tobi Lütke is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Shopify.

In 2004, Tobi began building software to launch an online snowboard store called Snowdevil. It quickly became obvious that the software was more valuable than the snowboards, so Tobi and his founding team launched the Shopify platform in 2008 built on Rails.

Tobi is a vocal advocate for sustainability, computer literacy, and education. He has served as a board member of Coinbase since 2022 and he is actively involved with the open source community, having contributed significantly to Ruby on Rails as one of the earliest members of Rails Core. He also created Liquid and ActiveMerchant, key libraries for ecommerce.

Tobi firmly believes that technology is essential for growth and innovation. He is passionate about paving the way for more builders.
