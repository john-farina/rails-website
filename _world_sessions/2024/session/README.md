### Plans on folder structure for agenda release. 

For now we can just put our sessions in the root of this folder as 
`%speakerFirstName-speakerLastName%.md` _(same as speakers file name)_

heres a example template :)

```md
---
layout: world/2024/session

time: 13:30 - 14:00
session_date: September 26th, 2024
