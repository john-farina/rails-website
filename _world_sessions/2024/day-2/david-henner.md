This presentation will first highlight some of the major improvements Zendesk has achieved using straightforward Ruby techniques. Data will illustrate the saving of thousands of years of processing time annually, leading to increased customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, as reflected in our AWS bills.

Fortunately, many of these enhancements are straightforward to implement from day one. My goal is to show folks how to incorporate these types of improvements early in their development process and share my learnings with the broader community.
