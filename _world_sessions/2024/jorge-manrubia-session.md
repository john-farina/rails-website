At 37signals, we’re working on a new product with some special needs regarding UI interactivity and fidelity.

Based on the previous experience with HEY – the product that helped shape Hotwire itself – and the new app’s particular needs, we developed a little Turbo addition that we believe can make a big difference for everyone.

In this talk, we’ll present the problem we are solving, where we are coming from, and where we landed. We’ll put an accent on how developer happiness and productivity play a crucial role in our decision process.
