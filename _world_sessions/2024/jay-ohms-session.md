Strada is the missing library to take your Turbo Native apps to the next level. Turbo Native enables web developers to ship native apps, but the experience is limited to a WebView container within a native shell. The native app doesnâ€™t have any knowledge about the web content that is being rendered, but Strada bridges that gap.

As part of the Hotwire family, Strada leverages the HTML you already have to enable high-fidelity native interactions on iOS and Android that are driven by your web app.
