### Plans on folder structure for agenda release. 

For now we can just put our sessions in the root of this folder as 
`%speakerFirstName-speakerLastName%-session.md`

```md
---
layout: world/2024/session
title: titlehere
speaker: john-farina.md # name of md speaker file
time: 13:30 - 14:00
location: Track 2
